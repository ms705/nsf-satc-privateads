\subsection{Online Advertising}

Today's web ecosystem crucially relies on online advertising as a source of
revenue for web services that are free to end users.
%
Advertising is a trillion-dollar market, with Google---one of the key
players---seeing revenue upwards of \$140B in 2020 alone~\cite{xxx}.
%
Much of online advertising is \emph{targeted}, meaning that different users
see different ads, targeted to their individual interests, as determined
from user behavior, browsing history, and demographic information.
%

%
Most websites and service operators that display ads outsource the choice of
which ads to show to a particular user to a third-party.
%
The ad market therefore involves interaction between three parties:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item the \textbf{advertiser}, who seeks to show ads to end users who
   are likely to engage with them (possibly spending money with the
   advertiser as a result), and who is willing to pay for users to view
   these ads;
 %
 \item the \textbf{publisher}, who operates a website that has an audience
   of users to whom advertisers might wish the advertise, and who seeks
   to monetize their content and audience by showing ads;
 %
 \item the \textbf{platform} or ``ad network'', who connects advertisers
   to publishers who have users with the right interest, and takes cut
   of the publisher's ad revenue; and
 %
 \item the \textbf{end user}, who uses the publisher's website and generates
   behavioral data (which could be sensitive) used for ad targeting in doing so,
   who sees the platform's chosen advertiser's ads and potentially interacts
   with them.
\end{enumerate}
%
Well-known platforms include Google's and Meta's Ad business, as well
as Bing Ads, Criteo, Zedo, and others.
%
As a middle-man between advertisers, publishers, and end users, the platform
holds tremendous power and receives significant sensitive information, including
who viewed which ad and whether they interacted with it.

\subsection{Ad Targeting}

%
In a \emph{targeted advertising} setting, a publisher shares information about
their users with the platform, and the platform chooses ads to show to the
users from their inventory of advertiser-provided ads.
