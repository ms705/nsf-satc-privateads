\noindent\textbf{PI Anna Lysyanskaya} is supported by:
\textit{(a) 2154170, 07/01/2022-06/30/2025, \$499,930 (b) ``SaTC: CORE: Small: Mercurial Signatures and Applications to Privacy-Preserving Authentication''}
\textit{(c,d,e)} None yet, project just started. \textit{ Intellectual merit}:  The goal of this project is to design and analyze new mercurial signatures with the aim of bridging the conceptual, security, and use-case disconnects of anonymous credentials to reduce the barriers to adoption of privacy-enhancing authentication services.
\textit{Broader Impacts:} Making anonymous authentication more accessible and efficient; diversity and educational impacts.  
\textit{(a) 2154170, 08/01/2022-1/1/2024, \$999,211 (b) ``PIPP Phase I: Mobility Analysis for Pandemic Prevention Strategies (MAPPS)''}
\textit{(c,d,e)} None yet, project just started. \textit{Intellectual merit}: Studying human mobility data in connection with the spread of disease, in a way that's ethical and respects privacy.
\textit{Broader Impacts:} Blunting the effect of pandemics.
