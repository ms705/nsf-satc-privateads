\paragraph{Overview.}
%
Todayâ€™s web ecosystem crucially relies on online advertising as a source of revenue for web services that are free to end users.  It consists of many mutually distrustful parties that rely on accountability and auditing mechanisms to ensure that the marketplace is fair.  Our goal is to realize these mechanisms without any need for any of these parties to track the users. 

\paragraph{Intellectual Merit.}
The research objective of this proposal is to design cryptographic protocols and computer systems that improve data privacy in web advertising.  To do so, we will design provably secure blind signatures and other untraceable cryptographic tokens; and we will develop software systems that incorporate these tokens into an ad ecosystem to ensure accountability in a privacy-preserving fashion.
