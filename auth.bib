abstract = {With the advancement in user-centric and URI-based identity systems over the past two years, it has become clear that a single specification will not be the solution to all problems. Rather, like the other layers of the Internet, developing small, interoperable specifications that are independently implementable and useful will ultimately lead to market adoption of these technologies. This is the intent of the OpenID framework. OpenID Authentication 1.0 began as a lightweight HTTP-based URL authentication protocol. OpenID Authentication 2.0 it is now turning into an open community-driven platform that allows and encourages innovation. It supports both URLs and XRIs as user identifiers, uses Yadis XRDS documents for identity service discovery, adds stronger security, and supports both public and private identifiers. With continuing convergence under this broad umbrella, the OpenID framework is emerging as a viable solution for Internet-scale user-centric identity infrastructure.},
