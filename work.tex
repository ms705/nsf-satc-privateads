\section{Collaboration and Work Plan}

\paragraph{Collaboration.}
%
The PIs are in the same department, and bring complementary expertise on cryptography and secure systems design.
%
In this proposal, Lysyanskaya contributes the primary expertise on blind signatures and cryptography, and lead the work on developing the new compact token and concurrently-secure anonymous credential schemes.
%
Schwarzkopf provides expertise on real-world distributed systems design, systems security, and the necessary efficiency for operation at scale.
%
He will lead the work on integrating the cryptographic primitives and protocols developed with server-side and client-side software; in particular, this will involve client browser modifications of an open-source browser (Mozilla Firefox or Chromium).
%
Both PIs will co-advise PhD students who work on this project, and jointly teach them how to design provably secure cryptographic primitives (Lysyanskaya taking the lead) and how to build scalable systems infrastructure (Schwarzkopf taking the lead).
%
The Brown CS graduate program is well suited towards this cross-area co-advising.
%
Schwarzkopf has experience doing systems work with students with a theory background (\eg having recently published a paper on GDPR compliance~\cite{gdprizer} with Seny Kamara's students), and Lysyanskaya has extensive experience working with students to design cryptographic primitives that are both secure and highly efficient (\todo{Anna example}).
%

\paragraph{Work Plan.}
%
\textbf{Year 1:} End-to-end system prototype based on existing crypto. Develop new crypto.
%
\textbf{Year 2:} Prove security of new crypto, integrate with prototype.
%
\textbf{Year 3:} Improve efficiently, build realistic at-scale prototype, publish work, open source software.
